# Image-Classifier
This project developed a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras, applied extensive data preprocessing and augmentation to the Fruits_Vegetables dataset, and performed a comprehensive evaluation (accuracy, precision, confusion matrix) to create a robust image classification model ready for real-time web deployment.
